# Ansible-CI-CD
This is for testing purposes.

## How this project works:
This is the Devops part of my final work. A pipeline will start when a pull request is received on the main branch. Then the Ansible code will be tested and only if it succeeds it will allow the user to merge the pull request.

## For what is this project used?
This project is used to automate the testing for Ansible code on a debian server. What I achieved was to be able to stage a debian server. Meaning that I put a default config on it. Here are some things the server will contain: Git, Htop, Apache, a user, a firewall...
